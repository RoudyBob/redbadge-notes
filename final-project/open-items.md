# Open Items

* [x] Time zone issue with Big Calendar causes new events to appear the day before they are entered. I believe this is because entries are using UTC and Big Calendar is displaying them in local TZ
* [x] Need to pull the date that was clicked on from Big Calendar and populate it when creating a new plan or new workout
* [x] Need to figure out how to refresh calendar on return from modals
* [x] Need to figure out how to get default units working
* [x] What happens if a user has no plans or workouts? Need to fix that.
* [x] Update sidebar to only show totals in units based on user's preference
* [x] If more than 2 items are on the calendar, the +more button doesn't work
* [x] Question: If I use an interface from somewhere else do I have to import it?
* [x] Plan creation needs modified if a coach is doing it
* [x] No user exists login breaks
* [x] sidebar doesn't update automatically
* [ ] Still issues with TZ - creating a new plan or workout is the next day if it's late enough
