# Open Items

* [x] Time zone issue with Big Calendar causes new events to appear the day before they are entered. I believe this is because entries are using UTC and Big Calendar is displaying them in local TZ
* [ ] Need to pull the date that was clicked on from Big Calendar and populate it when creating a new plan or new workout
* [ ] Need to figure out how to refresh calendar on return from modals
* [ ] Need to figure out how to get default units working
* [ ] What happens if a user has no plans or workouts? Need to fix that.
